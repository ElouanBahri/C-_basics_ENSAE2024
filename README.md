# Welcome to My C++ Basics Repository! 🎉

Hello there! 👋

Thank you for visiting this repository, which serves as a collection of my foundational explorations in C++. As I embarked on the journey to learn C++, I decided to share my progress, code snippets, and insights here. Whether you're new to C++ or just curious to see how I've approached learning the language, I hope you find something useful!

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains basic C++ programs and examples that demonstrate fundamental concepts. From simple "Hello, World!" programs to slightly more complex exercises, it's all part of my learning experience. Feel free to explore, learn, and even suggest improvements!

## ⚙️ Compilation Tips for macOS

If you're using the `clang++` compiler on macOS, here are a few important commands to help you get started:

To compile a C++ file (e.g, source_file.cpp) and generate an executable, use:
```bash
clang++ -o output_file_name source_file.cpp

```

Tu run the Compiled Program :

```bash
./output_file_name 

```

To format your code : 


```bash

clang-format -i src/TP2/Pointer_references_arrays.cpp
